### Professional Experience

<b>Louisiana Primary Care Association (July 2020 - Present)</b>

<i>Health Information Technology Data Analyst</i>

- I manage and develop methods for health data collection, analysis, visualizations, and reporting. I support and train community health centers to maximize their efficiency and optimize patient outcomes.

- LPCA represents 39 federally funded Community Health Center organizations across Louisiana. These organizations operate over 285 individual sites and serve over 444,000 patients a year.



<b>New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Bureau of HIV (June 2019 - December 2019)</b>

<i>College Aide, [HRTP](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/employment/hrtp-internship.page) Data Analyst</i>

- As a part of the HRTP internship program, I assisted the Bureau of HIV with analyzing Medicaid claims data and HIV surveillance data on transgender individuals and people living with HIV (PLWH). I programmed in SAS statistical software to analyze claims data from Medicaid and HIV data reported to the NYC health department. Additionally, I conceptualized an analysis on HIV viral suppression comparing transgender people who receive gender-affirming health care to non-transgender populations living with HIV.

<i>Graduate Research Assistant</i>

- I performed quantitative data analysis and interpretation in the ongoing cohort study Community Health Advisory Information Network (C.H.A.I.N.), which aims to improve the health of persons living with HIV/AIDS in New York City and the Tri-County region in collaboration with NYC DOHMH. I also wrote reports and presentations that respond to the questions, interests, and priorities of the HIV Planning Council, advising policy and funding decisions, as supported by grants from the Ryan White HIV Treatment Extension Act.
