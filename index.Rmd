I am a Vancouverite named after the [first man in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin). I received my BA from NYU in Psychology with Minors in Anthropology and Child & Adolescent Mental Health Studies ([CAMS](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/child-adolescent-psychiatry/education/child-adolescent-mental-health-studies-minor-undergraduates)). I am interested in social determinants of health and research data analysis, and now, data science!
